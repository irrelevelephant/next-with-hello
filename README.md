This example creates an authentication system that uses [Hell≈ç](https://www.hello.dev/) for user login and retrieving user claims. User data is then stored in a signed and encrypted session cookie with [`iron-session`](https://github.com/vvo/iron-session).

It is based off the <a href="https://github.com/hellocoop/greenfielddemo">Single Page Hell≈ç Demo App</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-iron-session">with-iron-session</a> example.

**Features of the example:**

- Login and update the user's profile with Hell≈ç.
- Login redirects and return URLs for both statically generated and server-side rendered pages.
- The logged in status is synchronized between browser windows/tabs using the **`useUser`** hook and the [`swr`](https://swr.vercel.app/).
- Session data is signed and encrypted in a cookie.
